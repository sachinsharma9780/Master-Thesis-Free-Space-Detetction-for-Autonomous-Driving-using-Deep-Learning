Given an input image the task is to detect free road areas in all the lanes. This is a task of semantic segmentation where we classify each pixel of an image into 3 different
classes i.e. ego lane (current driving lane), other lanes and background.

Requirements:

1) Pytorch-Cuda (version > 1.0)
2) Basic Machine learning libraries

Instructions to run the training script:
